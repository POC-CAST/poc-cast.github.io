**POCKET-CAST** combines two pivotal elements: **POCKET**, which stands for **Point-Of-Care Kinetics Examination Technologies**, and **CAST**, an acronym for **Combinational Antibiotics Susceptibility Test**. Point-of-care (POC) testing is conducted directly at the patient's location rather than in a central or external lab. POC tests are applicable to blood, urine, mucosal swabs, or saliva samples. With POCKET-CAST, our vision is to reshape the landscape of personalized medicine, especially targeting bacterial infections.

## Overview

In 2019, an alarming revelation spotlighted bacterial infections as the culprits behind a staggering 7.7 million global deaths, marking them as the second leading cause of death. Such infections, including urinary tract infections and food poisoning, have a profound impact on the quality of life. Traditional culture-based methods for bacterial ID and CAST, though pivotal, often require extended durations, leading to treatment delays and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Many existing diagnostic tools are either expensive, necessitate specialized training, or suffer from low throughput.

Given this backdrop, the dire need for a rapid, point-of-care diagnostic platform that can adeptly identify bacterial infections and gauge their antibiotic susceptibility has never been more evident.

Enter **POCKET-CAST**: Our state-of-the-art diagnostic platform engineered specifically for bacterial infections. Designed for both the general public and healthcare professionals, POCKET-CAST provides an intuitive POC diagnostic solution and a comprehensive antibiotic CAST system.
