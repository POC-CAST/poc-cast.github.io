**POC-CAST** stands for **Point-Of-Care Combinational Antibiotics Susceptibility Test**. Point-of-care (POC) testing is the diagnostic testing performed directly at the patient's location rather than in a central or external lab. POC tests can be conducted on blood, urine, mucosal swabs, or saliva. Our focus on POC-CAST is to revolutionize the personalized medicine paradigm, particularly in the realm of bacterial infections.

## Overview

Bacterial infections are an alarming global health concern. 7.7 million deaths worldwide, accounting for more than one-eighth of all fatalities, are attributed to bacterial infections, ranking them as the second leading cause of death. Diseases stemming from these infections, such as urinary tract infections, food poisoning, and skin infections, degrade the overall quality of life. The excessive diagnosis time taken by traditional culture-based methods coupled with the proliferation of antibiotic resistance due to over-reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics are the prime culprits behind the surge of bacterial infections.

Current diagnostic devices are either expensive, require specialized training, or are plagued by low throughput.

Thus, there's an urgent necessity for a point-of-care platform capable of diagnosing bacterial infections swiftly and precisely. Such a platform should not only detect bacteria but also test their susceptibility to various antibiotic combinations.

Introducing **POC-CAST**: our innovative diagnostic platform tailored for bacterial infections. POC-CAST offers a user-friendly POC diagnostic solution for the general public and a versatile antibiotic CAST system for professional healthcare providers.
